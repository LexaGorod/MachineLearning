# MachineLearning

My progress on machinelearning. 

For booksrecommendation.py you need csv datasets from http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/

economicdataprediction.py - carry out sentiment analysis of your company with help of twitter. if stock has good sentiment, it implements window method and keras to predict future prices

mnistImprovenetwork - Mnist network was taken from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. The problem sounds like "Modify network.py so that it uses this fully matrix-based approach instead of stochastic gradient descent loops over training examples in a mini-batch". So, those changes make the whole learning process 8 times faster.
